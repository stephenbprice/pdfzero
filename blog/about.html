title: What is PDFZero
---

<h2 class="section-heading">What</h2>

<p>
  PDFZero is a free, private PDF toolkit in your browser.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Free.</b> PDFZero is free to use. That's it - no limits on bandwith, no limits on uses-per-hour, no subscription, no freemium. Free.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Private.</b> Your files never leave your computer. Seriously - it works offline. When you visit a tool page, all of the code to modify your PDFs is downloaded as part of the webpage. Everything happens <em>on your own computer</em>, so nothing needs to be uploaded to the cloud.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  <b>In your browser.</b> Our webpages <em>are</em> our tools. Everyting you need to manipulate your documents is included in the html page itself. No need to install anything from us - just come prepared with a modern web browser. 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How</h2>
  
<p>
  Our site is built on top of some really awesome open-source tools. Notably, PDF.JS and PDF-Lib. These tools in turn allow us to display PDFs in your browser and manipulate them in pure javascript. And because javascript can run in a browser, you can use all of the tools without the files ever leaving your computer.
<p>
  
<h2 class="section-heading">Why</h2>

<p>
I do a lot of work with PDFs in my day job, and I know how important it is for small and medium-sized companies or departments to have PDF tools available for document management. With the development of the awesome open-source programming libraries above, I realized that many of the PDF tools typically hidden behind a paywall can be provided free of charge. We can afford free because we have no server costs - all of the computing power you use is <em>on your own computer</em>.
